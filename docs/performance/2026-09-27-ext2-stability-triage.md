# Ext2 stability triage for the Megrez desktop

The current writable Debian partition is ext2. A clean `e2fsck` after one
normal boot proves only that particular boot ended with consistent metadata.
It does not establish crash consistency or rule out a latent kernel bug.

## What the evidence establishes

| Date | Observation | What remains unknown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| September 15 | After an emergency kernel restart, offline `e2fsck -fn` found dangling `man-db` and `openbox` directory entries, link and bitmap mismatches. A second emergency restart produced another stale `man-db` entry. See the [physical time ledger](2026-09-15-firefox-physical-time-ledger.md). | No preboot check existed for the first run. The second run confirms new damage but cannot separate ext2's unjournaled crash window from an Asterinas implementation defect. |
| September 26, first recovery | Firefox saw `ESTALE` for `user.js`; fsck found an entry pointing to a deleted inode and an invalid HTree index. Commit `b063c147f` makes linear directory mutations clear `INDEX_DIR`. A focused QEMU test passed, and the repaired board booted Firefox. See the [recovery evidence](../porting/evidence/2026-09-26-browserweb-ext2-recovery/README.md). | The test proves the index flag behavior, not that all profile metadata writes are crash-safe. |
| September 26, DMA preflight | Another profile failure included `user.js` and `.startup-incomplete` pointing at deleted inodes, `prefs.js` pointing at a directory, and multiply-claimed blocks among Firefox files. The unmounted 4 GiB partition was imaged and hash-checked before offline repair. A subsequent clean desktop boot ended with fsck exit 0. See the [complete fsck logs](../porting/evidence/2026-09-26-megrez-powervr-dma-preflight/README.md). | Neither the PowerVR firmware copy nor the DMA preflight is established as the cause. The ext2 fault source is still open. |

The RockOS RTC lagged behind Asterinas, so a future superblock timestamp was
reported separately. That clock warning did not account for the structural
errors. `e2fsck` exit 4 means errors remain uncorrected; exit 1 means repairs
were made, and exit 0 means that check found no errors.

Ext2 has no metadata journal. An abrupt restart can expose partly completed
directory, inode, and bitmap updates; Linux's ext2 documentation identifies
this as a reason for post-crash checking. A file `fsync` alone does not
necessarily persist its parent directory entry. These facts make crash timing
a plausible explanation, not a diagnosis of the Asterinas implementation.
See the [ext2 documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/6.1/filesystems/ext2.html),
[fsync manual](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html), and
[e2fsck exit-code manual](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/e2fsck.8.html).

## Immediate operating rule

1. Before every writable selected boot, check the **unmounted** partition
   from RockOS (`/dev/mmcblk1p2`, UUID
   `c2ce5134-afcc-4d7c-b71e-7e6d4a8f2b10`) with `e2fsck -fn` and require
   exit 0. Asterinas names this partition `/dev/mmcblk0p2`. Keep the raw
   September 15 and September 26 images until the fault is classified.
2. If fsck fails, stop the selected boot. Capture its full output and a
   byte-verified partition image before considering an offline repair. Never
   run a modifying fsck while mounted, and do not make `e2fsck -y` an
   automatic boot step.
3. Use the bounded userspace shutdown path and verify its `SYNC_DONE` marker
   before relying on a clean reboot. Preserve the kernel watchdog and the
   RockOS default as recovery paths. Run another offline read-only fsck after
   each short experiment; a 4 GiB check took only seconds in the DMA session.
4. Do not treat the selected GPU boot script as exempt from the writable-boot
   guard. `megrez_board_session.py` validates the userspace/kernel deadline
   pair in its CLI parser, but direct users of `uboot_bootargs_commands()`
   bypass that check. Also, `megrez_safe_reboot.sh` currently parses the kernel
   deadline only when `ASTERINAS_SAFE_REBOOT_AFTER` is absent; with an explicit
   deadline it loses its internal kernel-deadline bound. Fix and test both
   guards before more unattended writable board boots. These are verified
   guard gaps, not proven causes of the previous corruption.

## Short diagnostic sequence

1. Clone one clean ext2 QEMU image for each run. Use the Firefox profile's
   actual create/replace/rename/unlink/SQLite-shm pattern, not a long load.
   The existing 16-cycle recovery gate does `sync` and unmount, then checks
   fsck; retain it as the clean-shutdown baseline.
2. Add controlled cut points after directory entry mutation, inode link-count
   writeback, block release/reallocation, and sync completion. For each cut,
   run offline `e2fsck -fn` and save the first failing operation and affected
   inode/block IDs. Run the same operations on Linux ext2 as a reference.
3. If a clean `sync`/unmount run fails, trace Asterinas writeback and
   allocation ordering first. If failures occur only at power cuts, compare
   their type and frequency with Linux ext2 before labeling them an
   Asterinas-specific bug. Turn a reproducible difference into a focused
   regression test and fix one cause at a time.

For experimental GPU boots, a read-only base plus tmpfs/overlay upper layer
can keep Firefox's write-heavy profile away from the persistent ext2 image,
at the cost of losing that profile on reboot. This is a containment measure,
not a durable desktop solution. A persistent journaled filesystem is the
longer-term route to robust daily use; the current Asterinas filesystem
registry includes ext2 and overlayfs but no ext4 implementation. Simply
reformatting this partition as ext4 would make it unmountable by today's
kernel. Linux's [ext4 journal documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/ext4/journal.html)
describes the metadata protection that a future implementation would need.
