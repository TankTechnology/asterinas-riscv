# RISC-V firmware boot validation

This directory validates the firmware-to-kernel handoff without modeling a single development board in QEMU.
The same runner describes a machine contract, a boot flow, and the observable milestones expected from the guest.
The registered profiles currently cover QEMU `virt`, SiFive U, Sv39, and the Sv48/Svade/Svadu envelope used by the Megrez integration.

The checks are evidence, not hardware emulation.
A passing profile proves the declared CPU, MMU, DTB, U-Boot `booti`, and userspace contracts.
It does not claim that QEMU reproduces unmodeled clocks, resets, cache controllers, or board peripherals.

## Unit tests

Run the repository-contract tests before launching QEMU:

```bash
make test_riscv_uboot_booti_unit
```

These tests validate immutable profile definitions, address ranges, generated commands, DTB policy, milestone accounting, result classification, cleanup, and artifact identity checks.

## Generic U-Boot `booti`

Provide a RISC-V Linux Image and initramfs, then run the generic profile.

```bash
make test_riscv_uboot_booti \
  ASTERINAS_RISCV_BOOTI="$PWD/target/osdk/aster-kernel/aster-kernel-osdk-bin.Image" \
  ASTERINAS_INITRAMFS=/absolute/path/to/initramfs
```

Generated U-Boot, DTB, disk, logs, and JSON evidence stay below `target/`.

## SiFive U

Use the same Asterinas artifacts to validate the SiFive UART path through U-Boot and userspace.

```bash
make test_riscv_sifive_u \
  ASTERINAS_RISCV_BOOTI="$PWD/target/osdk/aster-kernel/aster-kernel-osdk-bin.Image" \
  ASTERINAS_INITRAMFS=/absolute/path/to/initramfs
```

An optional Linux control run uses the same machine and evidence path.

```bash
make test_riscv_sifive_u_linux_reference \
  RISCV_LINUX_IMAGE=/absolute/path/to/Image \
  RISCV_LINUX_INITRAMFS=/absolute/path/to/initramfs
```

The Asterinas run is accepted only after its userspace marker appears.
Firmware output alone is not sufficient.

## Dependencies

Use the repository development container.
Preparing U-Boot additionally needs the RISC-V cross compiler, `dtc`, OpenSSL/GnuTLS development packages, and the Python development headers and `setuptools` used to build `pylibfdt`.
The unit tests use only the Python standard library and repository files.

Profiles are reviewed code objects; command-line CPU, memory, bootarg, and resource-gate overrides are intentionally restricted.
Add a new machine by defining its contract and tests instead of adding board-specific branches to the runner.
